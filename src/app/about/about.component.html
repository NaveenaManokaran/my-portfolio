        I'm Naveena, a Front End developer with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science & Engineering.
        Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer in LTI, India. As a UI developer,
        I would provide a UI solution to the end user, considering the final look, feel and behavior of the module in
        all aspects. My primary goal is to get an overall good user experience. Implementing visual elements that users
        see and interact with in a web application has been my passion over the years. I believe that a successful
        product is a mixture of good design, experience and
        technology.
        <br>
        <br> Apart from my work, when I’m not behind my Laptop you can see me sitting in a cafe sipping a hot cup of
        Cappuccino or watching horror movies or surfing in internet. Since I love travelling, I take trips at least
        Twice in a year to detach from daily routine and recharge myself. Currently, I’m based in Bangalore, Karnataka,
        But originally from the cultural capital Tamilnadu, India.
